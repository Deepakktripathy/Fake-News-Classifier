# FakeNewsClassifier

This project aims to detect fake news using machine learning algorithms. The project is implemented using a dataset consisting of real and fake news articles. The steps involved are as follows:

Data Collection: A dataset containing real and fake news articles is collected.

Data Preprocessing: The data is preprocessed by removing stop words, stemming and lemmatizing.

Feature Extraction: The TF-IDF vectorization technique is used to extract features from the preprocessed data.

Model Building: Passive Aggressive Classifier is built and trained on the dataset.

Model Evaluation: The performance of the models is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, each having a score of around 94%
